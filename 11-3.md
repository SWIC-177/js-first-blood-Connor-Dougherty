## Comfort about the lesson and analogies

  I did this part of the homework second, so that'd I'd be able to watch the videos to be able to understand the lesson a lot better. And I'm glad to say that my idea worked, after watching the videos first I definitely understand it more and am a lot for comfortable with the deep concepts. For analogies or perspectives, I don't really have any analogies or perspectives about the concepts. You kinda just got to program the multiplier and  know what your multiplying.

## My thoughts and perspectives

 My thoughts and perspectives on the deep concepts are nothing big or major, the thoughts and perspectives are that the "first class citizen" analogy is pretty accurate. Functions are like one of the most useful and important concept in Javascript, so of course itd be treated as the first class citizen it deservers to be.

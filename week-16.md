## My thoughts on the assignment

    As with this class I was very confused, mostly from the directions. The directions kinda overwhelmed and confused me from just how long it was too begin with, truthfully i had to have someone dumb them down for me. But after finally knowing what to do, it got alot easier since most of it was following the code in the videos and adding some tweaks or changes. So I guess the main trouble i had with it was just the beginning.

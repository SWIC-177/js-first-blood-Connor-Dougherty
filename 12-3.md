# The Multi-Paradigm Nature of JavaScript

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language, meaning it supports various programming styles and paradigms, including:

- **Procedural Programming**: JavaScript can be used for procedural programming, where you write a sequence of instructions for the computer to follow.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: JavaScript also supports OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Functional Programming**: JavaScript has features that support functional programming, such as first-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions.

## DOM

What DOM means to me is a way for programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of a web page. Im anticipating that we're gonna go back to HTML stuff, and that we're doing it again cause some websites have special functions that html cant do alone and will need the help of JS to do.

## Benefits of Using a Single Object Instead of Multiple Arguments

When passing data to a function, it's often better to use a single object instead of multiple arguments. This approach has several benefits:

1. **Improved Readability**: Using an object makes the code more readable and self-documenting, as you can use descriptive property names instead of relying on positional arguments.
2. **Flexibility**: With an object, you can add or remove properties without changing the function signature, making it easier to extend or modify the function in the future.
3. **Default Values**: When using an object, you can easily provide default values for properties that are not explicitly passed.

## Destructuring

Destructuring is a JavaScript syntax that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to separate variables. For example:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person; 

function greet(name = 'Guest') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet(); 
greet('John'); 

function printDetails({ name = 'Guest', age = 30 } = {}) {
  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
}

printDetails({ name: 'John', age: 25 }); 
printDetails({});

## Filtering in JavaScript

Filtering is a common operation in JavaScript where you create a new array with elements that pass a certain condition. The `filter()` method is used for this purpose.

### `filter()` Method

The `filter()` method creates a new array filled with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In the example above, the `filter()` method creates a new array `evenNumbers` containing only the even numbers from the `numbers` array.

The `filter()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed on each element of the array. If the callback function returns `true`, the element is included in the new array. If it returns `false`, the element is excluded.

You can also use the `filter()` method with objects:

```js
const users = [
  { id: 1, active: true },
  { id: 2, active: false },
  { id: 3, active: true }
];

const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.active);
console.log(activeUsers); // Output: [{ id: 1, active: true }, { id: 3, active: true }]
```

In this example, the `filter()` method creates a new array `activeUsers` containing only the objects where the `active` property is `true`.

The `filter()` method is a powerful tool for working with arrays and objects in JavaScript. It allows you to create new arrays based on specific conditions, making your code more readable and maintainable.

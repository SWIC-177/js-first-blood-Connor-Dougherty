## The Simularities between our videos
  The obvious simmularity between our videos is the fact we both go over the same problem/code. Another simularity is the amount of lines we use, we both end up with a total of 34 lines for our code. Thats pretty much where the simularites between our videos end.
## The differences between our videos
  from the get-go its pretty obvious that your alot more confident than i was while recording and talking about the code, this makes sense since you've been doing this for a long time. Another obvious difference is the use of ai in your video, in your video you use ai to type out the code needed and then you edit what it typed for you. In my video I didnt use ai, mostly cause i dont have the copilot for vscode or github.
## What I learned form your video
   To clarify i think using ai for coding is okay, in fact your video showed it in action. I probably should have used copilot from the start for this class, it probably would have helped me out a ton on the harder assignments.

## What I saw during the lesson and videos

In the videos and lesson you taught us the basics of BOM and DOM. With being a visual learner, I pretty much could only pay attention to the videos but I did read the lesson but probably didn't retail info as well as i could with the videos. So basically in the first vid (BOM v DOM) you just taught us about BOM and DOM simularites and differences. However in the videos BOM and DOM Demo 1, BOM and DOM 2, BOM and DOM 3 were more of a long and helpful example of how to actually use BOM and DOM. The website you edit using the 2 methods was the WWE and WWEshop websites. More importantly you edit the buy button to say "Remove from Cart" and once clicked it says "I acknowledge the Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns!".

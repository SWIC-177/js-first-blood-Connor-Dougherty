## Whats changed
The main change I've noticed is the addition of the "Math" namespace object. Whats noticeably new about it is you cant use it with the new operator or invoking the Math object as a function. Id say all the concepts have been made clearer to from watching the book videos that you made. Personally i dont think im struggling with stuff in th chapter but i could be wrong. I personally dont really have many thoughts about methods.

## What I learned

What i learned from the videos is the explanations of closures and map methods. a closure is a function that has access to variables in an outer (enclosing) function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. It is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The map() method in JavaScript is an array method that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element of the calling array. In programming, both map and for/while loops are used to iterate over elements in a collection (such as lists, arrays, or other data structures), but they have different approaches and use cases.

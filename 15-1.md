## `describe`

`describe` is a function provided by testing frameworks such as Jest and Mocha. It's used to group related tests together and provide a descriptive label for the group. Here's an example:

```js
describe("Math utilities", () => {
  // Tests for math utilities go here
});
```

## `reduce`

`reduce` is an array method in JavaScript that applies a function of two arguments against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. It's useful for tasks like summing up values, flattening nested arrays, and more. Here's an example:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  0,
);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

My Personal thoughts on `reduce` is, that at first i didn't really understand it. However I can say that i understand it now, and I don't think its too much, i think its a good method to use in javascript.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where tests are written before the actual implementation code. It follows a cycle of:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code
4. Repeat

By following TDD, you end up with well-tested, modular, and maintainable code. Here's an example of a TDD cycle using Jest:

```js
// 1. Write a failing test
describe("sum", () => {
  it("should add two numbers", () => {
    expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });
});

// 2. Write the minimal code to make the test pass
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// 3. Refactor the code (if needed)
```

TDD encourages developers to think about the desired behavior of their code before writing it, leading to more robust and testable code.

```javascript
// Array to be filtered
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Filter out even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Filter out numbers greater than 5
const lessThanFive = numbers.filter(number => number < 5);
console.log(lessThanFive); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Filter out objects based on a property
const products = [
  { name: 'Product 1', price: 10 },
  { name: 'Product 2', price: 20 },
  { name: 'Product 3', price: 15 },
  { name: 'Product 4', price: 25 }
];

const expensiveProducts = products.filter(product => product.price > 15);
console.log(expensiveProducts);
// Output: [{ name: 'Product 2', price: 20 }, { name: 'Product 4', price: 25 }]
```

In this gist, we have:

1. An array of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
2. We use the `filter` method to create a new array `evenNumbers` containing only the even numbers from the original array.
3. We use the `filter` method again to create a new array `lessThanFive` containing only the numbers less than 5 from the original array.
4. We have an array of objects `products` representing products with `name` and `price` properties.
5. We use the `filter` method to create a new array `expensiveProducts` containing only the products with a price greater than 15.

The `filter` method takes a callback function that is executed for each element in the array. If the callback function returns `true` for an element, that element is included in the new filtered array. If the callback function returns `false`, the element is excluded from the new array.

In the examples above, we use arrow functions as the callback functions for the `filter` method. You can also use regular functions or any other valid JavaScript function expressions.

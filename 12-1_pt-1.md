## My thoughts on Pass by stuff

My thoughts on Pass by stuff, I think its super useful since it essentially makes it so i dont have to fully retype the info the code needs. How i would explain it someone is basically like how it works is that it goes up and just looks at the info and makes slight changes if the changes are specified. Analogies id use is maybe a cart on rails, like a straight piece of track its on. The kart just goes up and sees what the info is, then goes and comes back with info needed.

## What could help me understand better
  I kinda already said this in a previous MD assignment thingy, but the thing that would really help me is video examples. I personally learn better with demonstrations and videos of the subject, like having to only read and look at pics just usually ends up with me getting confused.
## The concepts and their relatability 
  The whole "Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms from which data structures are built. Many types of information require more than one atom, though." example was probably the clearest one for me. However the were-squirrel stuff kinda confused me, until I realized that its supposed to be the introduction to a problem. The only class that I had before this one that I can relate anything to was the c++ and html5 classes that i took, espically with concepts like loops, strings, or arrays. 
##  what I got out of the chapter
  The chapter felt like a review of last weeks stuff with a little bit added onto it, so it didnt feel too confusing for the most part. However when it got to the new stuff, thats when it got confusing for me and im honsetly still trying to grasp it.
